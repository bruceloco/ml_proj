This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit**c button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}

# enable hardware acceleration
library(doParallel)
cl<-makeCluster(detectCores())
registerDoParallel(cl)

```

```{r}
# load test and train sets

testing<-read.csv("pml-testing.csv",na.strings = "NA")
training<-read.csv("pml-training.csv",na.strings = "NA")
# clean the data
str(training)
# avg/stdev is self contained information, all other information which is mostly NA's will not be selected, so a list will be created with the column names to use:
list_use <-c("roll_belt","pitch_belt","yaw_belt","total_accel_belt","gyros_belt_x","gyros_belt_y","gyros_belt_z","accel_belt_x","accel_belt_y","accel_belt_z","magnet_belt_x","magnet_belt_y","magnet_belt_z","roll_arm","pitch_arm","yaw_arm","total_accel_arm","gyros_arm_x","gyros_arm_y","gyros_arm_z","accel_arm_x","accel_arm_y","accel_arm_z","magnet_arm_x","magnet_arm_y","magnet_arm_z","roll_dumbbell","pitch_dumbbell","yaw_dumbbell","total_accel_dumbbell","gyros_dumbbell_x","gyros_dumbbell_y","gyros_dumbbell_z","accel_dumbbell_x","accel_dumbbell_y","accel_dumbbell_z","magnet_dumbbell_x","magnet_dumbbell_y","magnet_dumbbell_z","roll_forearm","pitch_forearm","yaw_forearm","total_accel_forearm","gyros_forearm_x","gyros_forearm_y","gyros_forearm_z","accel_forearm_x","accel_forearm_y","accel_forearm_z","magnet_forearm_x","magnet_forearm_y","magnet_forearm_z","classe")
testing<-testing[,list_use[-53]]
training<-training[,list_use]

# now create a cross validation set based on the training set, ie: split it into training/test sets
set.seed(33737) 
idx_train<-createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
strain<-training[idx_train,]
stest<-training[-idx_train,]
mtree<-train(classe ~., data=strain, method="rf")
prtree<-predict(mtree, stest)
mpca <-train(classe ~., data=strain, method="rf",preProcess="pca")

confusionMatrix(stest$classe,prtree)$overall['Accuracy']
#

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
